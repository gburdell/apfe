1) Generate phase needs to handle left recursion ala LeftRecursiveAcceptor.
   The getChoice() template might as well be used for the alternative
   rather than PrioritizedChoice constructor.

2) While handling left-recursion, also look for DRR (Definate Right Recursion)

3) For now, since indirect lr is not handled; just look for 1st element of
   alternative and also need getNonRecursiveChoiceIx() too.
